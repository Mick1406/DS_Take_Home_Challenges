# DS_Take_Home_Challenges
This repo contains the solutions to a couple of Data Science take home challenges I did for practice
<br>

## Take home challenges
- __User referral program__: Estimating the impact of a referral program
- __Funnel Analysis__: Analysis of funnel conversion rate of an e-commerce website

## Structure
Each take home challenge is in its folder and contains the csv data file(s) as well as a Jupyter notebook which contains the analysis.
<br> The challenge description is included at the beginning of each notebook
