# DS_Take_Home_Challenges
This repo contains the solutions to a few Data Science take home challenges I did for practice. Those are a bit easier than real-life challenge though.
<br>

## Take home challenges
- __User referral program__: Estimating the impact of a referral program
- __Funnel Analysis__: Analysis of funnel conversion rate of an e-commerce website
- __Song Challenge__: Analysis of a music streaming company, working with json files

## Repo Structure
Each take home challenge is in its folder and contains the data file(s) as well as a Jupyter notebook which contains the analysis.
<br> The challenge description is included at the beginning of each notebook

## Credits
The challenges are from the book __A Collection of Data Science Take-Home Challenges__ authored by Giulio Palombo
